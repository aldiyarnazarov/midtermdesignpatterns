# Midterm Exam Tasks

This midterm consists of **three** design pattern implementation tasks. Students must accumulate **100 points** total out of the **available 200 points** (100 + 60 + 40). Depending on each student’s preferred approach, they can:

- **Complete the single advanced task** (Smart Home Control System) worth **100 points**, **OR**
- **Combine** the **Online Payment Gateway** (60 points) with the **Coffee Shop Simulator** (40 points) to total **100 points**, **OR**
- **Mix & Match** further if your instructor allows partial completion or additional features for extra credit.

> You only need **100 points** to fulfill the midterm requirement.

## Smart Home Control System (Advanced – 100 points)

**Design Patterns to Apply:**  
- **Composite**
- **Decorator**
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Facade**
- **Adapter**

### Task Overview
Implement a **Smart Home Control System** simulating how various smart devices (e.g., lights, thermostats, security cameras) are managed and controlled. This project aims to demonstrate a complex interaction of multiple components using the mentioned design patterns.

### Requirements Breakdown

1. **Composite Pattern**  
   - Organize individual devices (leaf nodes) and groups of devices (composite nodes) such as rooms or floors.  
   - A composite node can contain multiple devices (e.g., multiple lights and a thermostat in a single room).

2. **Decorator Pattern**  
   - Dynamically add or modify a device’s functionality (e.g., adding logging, scheduling, or a power-saving mode).  
   - Example: Decorate a `Light` device with a `ScheduledOperationDecorator` to turn it on/off at set times.

3. **Abstract Factory Pattern**  
   - Create families of related devices. For example:  
     - `BasicSmartHomeFactory` to produce standard devices.  
     - `AdvancedSmartHomeFactory` for high-end devices with extra features (AI-based thermostats, advanced sensors, etc.).  
   - Ensures consistent interfaces when creating multiple device types at once.

4. **Facade Pattern**  
   - Provide a simplified interface (e.g., `SmartHomeController`) to manage all devices. For example:  
     - `turnAllLightsOn()`, `setGlobalTemperature()`, `getSystemStatusReport()`  
   - Clients interact with the Facade without needing to understand the underlying complexities.

5. **Adapter Pattern**  
   - Integrate at least one external or legacy system. For example:  
     - A legacy door lock system, or a third-party weather API for the thermostat.  
   - The Adapter ensures the external system’s interface aligns with the rest of your smart home design.

### Deliverables
- **Source Code** demonstrating each pattern:  
  - Composite structure for the device hierarchy.  
  - Decorator classes for extended functionality.  
  - At least two factories (basic vs. advanced).  
  - A single Facade for central control.  
  - An Adapter for a third-party or legacy system.
- **Short Demo** (CLI or basic GUI) that shows:  
  - Adding devices to composite structures.  
  - Decorating devices with extra behaviors (logging, scheduling, etc.).  
  - Using the Facade to issue commands.  
  - Integrating the adapted component.

### Point Allocation (Example)
- Implementation & correctness of patterns (50 points)  
- Quality & clarity of the Facade and composite structure (20 points)  
- Proper use of factories (10 points)  
- Proper use of decorators (10 points)  
- Adapter integration (10 points)

## Online Payment Gateway (Intermediate – 60 points)

**Design Patterns to Apply:**  
- **Factory Method**
- **Adapter**

### Task Overview
Create a **Payment Platform** that supports multiple payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal, cryptocurrency). This system should handle basic transactions and integrate at least one external or legacy API.

### Requirements Breakdown

1. **Factory Method Pattern**  
   - Encapsulate the creation of different payment method objects, such as `CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`, and `CryptoPayment`.  
   - Each payment class implements a common interface, e.g., `PaymentMethod` with `processPayment(amount)`.  
   - Show how a `PaymentFactory` (or multiple factories) instantiates the correct payment class based on user selection or configuration.

2. **Adapter Pattern**  
   - Integrate at least one external or mock API. For example:  
     - A payment validation library for credit cards.  
     - A simplified test service representing PayPal’s API calls.  
   - The Adapter ensures external API calls conform to the internal `PaymentMethod` interface.

3. **Additional Complexity or Features** (to justify 60 points instead of 40):  
   - Include transaction status (pending, completed, failed).  
   - Maintain a transaction history or log.  
   - Provide minimal error handling or exceptions (e.g., insufficient funds, invalid credentials).  
   - (Optional) Implement partial or staged payments if appropriate.

### Deliverables
- **Source Code**:
  - Payment classes for each method, created via the Factory Method.
  - An Adapter class to communicate with at least one external/mock payment service.
  - Additional features such as transaction logging or error handling.
- **Demo Application**:
  - A console or minimal GUI where users can:
    - Select the payment type.
    - Enter payment details (e.g., fake credit card info, PayPal account).
    - Process a transaction (simulate success/failure).
    - Possibly view a transaction history and statuses.

### Point Allocation (Example)
- Correct Factory Method implementation (25 points)  
- Adapter integration with an external or mock API (20 points)  
- Transaction management, logging, or error-handling features (15 points)

## Coffee Shop Simulator (Easy – 40 points)

**Design Patterns to Apply:**  
- **Factory Method**
- **Decorator**

### Task Overview
Build a **Coffee Ordering System** where customers can choose different coffee drinks and dynamically add extra ingredients or toppings.

### Requirements Breakdown

1. **Factory Method Pattern**  
   - A `CoffeeFactory` that creates different coffee objects (e.g., `Espresso`, `Cappuccino`, `Latte`, `Americano`).  
   - Each coffee type implements a common `Coffee` interface (e.g., `getCost()`, `getDescription()`).

2. **Decorator Pattern**  
   - Add ingredients (milk, caramel syrup, whipped cream, chocolate syrup) dynamically.  
   - Decorators wrap the `Coffee` object to modify cost and description.  
   - Example: `ChocolateDecorator` adds “Chocolate Syrup” to `getDescription()` and increases the cost accordingly.

### Deliverables
- **Source Code**:
  - Classes for each coffee type.  
  - Decorator classes for toppings.  
- **Demo Application**:
  - A console or lightweight GUI where users:
    - Select a coffee base from the factory.
    - Choose multiple toppings/ingredients.
    - Displays final cost and description of the customized coffee.

### Point Allocation (Example)
- Correct Factory Method for coffee types (20 points)  
- Correct Decorator implementation for toppings (10 points)  
- Clarity of the final solution & demonstration (10 points)

## General Guidelines

1. **Programming Language/Framework**  
   - Feel free to use Java, C#, Python, or any language you prefer, unless otherwise specified by your instructor.

2. **Documentation**  
   - Ensure your code is well-commented, highlighting how and where each design pattern is applied.  
   - Provide a brief overview (in a README or doc comments) describing your system’s architecture.

3. **Collaboration**  
   - Students may work individually or in small teams (2–3), based on instructor policy.

4. **Testing**  
   - Include basic tests or demonstrations to show how each feature works.

## Scoring Suggestions

- **Total Available Points:** **200**  
  1. **Smart Home Control System** (100 points)  
  2. **Online Payment Gateway** (60 points)  
  3. **Coffee Shop Simulator** (40 points)

- **You Need 100 Points:**  
  - **Option A:** Do the **Smart Home Control System** alone for a full 100 points.  
  - **Option B:** Combine **Online Payment Gateway (60 points)** + **Coffee Shop Simulator (40 points)** = 100 points exactly.  
  - **Option C:** If you complete more than 100 points worth of tasks or add extra features, that is up to you—only 100 is required for the midterm.
